# Joco Neovim Config

## Todo List
- Finish configuring LSP (Key bindings)
- Move LSP server setup from init.vim to a better location.
- Finish configuring cmp
- Install telescope
- Figure out something for search highlighting (typing :nohl after each search is crazy)
- Find some nice workflow with tabs or window splitting. 
- Setup airline (priority 49 out of 50)
