# Joco Neovim Config

## Todo List
- Finish configuring LSP (Key bindings)
- Move LSP server setup from init.vim to a better location.
- Finish configuring cmp
- Install telescope
- DONE - Figure out something for search highlighting (typing :nohl after each search is crazy) [Solution: nnoremap :nohl to enter]
- Find some nice workflow with tabs or window splitting. I think I'm gonna need some way switching between buffers(tabs), opening them telescope will take care and some ways to split window.
- DONE - Setup airline 
- DONE - Enable font ligatures (Looks like I have to swtich terminal emulator.). [Solution: switched from gnome-terminal to Konsole and using font JetBrans Mono]
- Setup git (at least show changes, etc on the side)
